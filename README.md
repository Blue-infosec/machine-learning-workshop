# Machine Learning for Research Workshop

![](img/ids-net.png)

This repo is for Machine Learning Workshop (one episode of  Data Science Community Workshop Series)

This machine learning workshop is hosted by institute of data science at Maastricht University on 24th of April, 2018. This comprehensive workshop will be your guide to learning how to use powerful machine learning algorithms! We will introduce you to machine learning algorithms, why it works effectively and efficiently, and how they can be applied to specific domains. This workshop is designed for anyone interested in getting started with machine learning, however more experienced students and academics are also welcome to join!

More material will be uploaded soon!

## Machine Learning tools mentioned in the workshop:

Weka: a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 

KNIME: a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform 	www.knime.org

Tensorflow: Created by Google Brain for internal google use. Released in 2015, it is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.  www.tensorflow.org

Spark MLlib: Usable in Java, Scala, Python, and R, It is a Spark library, so you need to use Spark first then this library. Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework. https://spark.apache.org/mllib/ 

Scikit Learn: a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ 

Turicreate: Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert. https://github.com/apple/turicreate 

H2O.ai: H2O.ai makes machine learning accessible and allows business users to extract insights from data, without needing expertise in deploying or tuning machine learning models https://www.h2o.ai/ 

PYTORCH: PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch. It provides a wide range of algorithms for deep learning. http://pytorch.org/ 

Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. https://keras.io/

Shogun:Python, Octave, Java / Scala, Ruby, C#, R, Lua. They are currently working on adding more languages including JavaScript, D, and Matlab. https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun 

Deeplearn.js: an open-source library that brings performant machine learning building blocks to the web https://deeplearnjs.org/ 

ConvNetJS: a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (Neural Networks) entirely in your browser https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/
