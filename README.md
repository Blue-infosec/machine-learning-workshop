![](img/ids-net.png)

This repo is for Machine Learning Workshop (one episode of  Data Science Community Workshop Series)

This machine learning workshop is hosted by institute of data science at Maastricht University on 24th of April, 2018. This comprehensive workshop will be your guide to learning how to use powerful machine learning algorithms! We will introduce you to machine learning algorithms, why it works effectively and efficiently, and how they can be applied to specific domains. This workshop is designed for anyone interested in getting started with machine learning, however more experienced students and academics are also welcome to join!

More material will be uploaded soon!
